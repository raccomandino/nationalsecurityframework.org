<p>Tell your tutor, human resources team or line manager if you have a complaint &#8211; your organisation may be able to solve your problem informally.</p>



<p>There’s a different procedure for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/appeal-exam-result">appealing exam results</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="make-a-formal-complaint">Make a formal complaint</h2>



<p>You can make a formal complaint if you are not able to solve your issue informally.</p>



<p>You must follow your organisation’s published complaints procedure.</p>



<p>If you do not have the complaints procedure ask the human resources team or people manager at your organisation for a copy.</p>



<p>The complaints procedure should tell you:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>what you need to send to make your complaint, for example a completed form or written evidence</li>



<li>where to send your complaint</li>



<li>how the organisation will treat your complaint, for example who will see it and possible outcomes</li>



<li>when you can expect a decision</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="if-youre-unhappy-with-the-outcome">If you’re unhappy with the outcome</h2>



<p>You can complain to the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) about how your complaint was handled as long as your organisation is one of the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>a further education college</li>



<li>a learning organisation that offers qualifications or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apprenticeships-guide">apprenticeship schemes</a></li>



<li>a sixth form college that is not an academy</li>



<li>a learning organisation that offers courses for people who are under 25 and have a learning disability</li>
</ul>



<p>The&nbsp;ESFA&nbsp;does not deal with complaints about employment issues (for example, a problem with your contract if you’re working as an apprentice).</p>



<p>There’s a different procedure if your complaint was with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/complain-about-an-academy/complain-about-an-academy">an academy</a>.</p>



<p>You must contact the&nbsp;ESFA&nbsp;within 12 months after the issue happened.</p>



<p>Email or post your complaint to the&nbsp;ESFA&nbsp;complaints team.</p>



<p>ESFA complaints team<br><a href="mailto:Customer.Complaints@education.gov.uk">Customer.Complaints@education.gov.uk</a></p>



<p>Complaints team<br>Education and Skills Funding Agency<br>Cheylesmore House<br>Quinton Road<br>Coventry<br>CV1 2WT</p>



<p>The&nbsp;ESFA&nbsp;will reply to let you know what will happen next.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="if-youre-unhappy-with-the-esfa-response">If you’re unhappy with the&nbsp;ESFA&nbsp;response</h3>



<p>You can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education/about/complaints-procedure">contact the Department for Education</a>&nbsp;if you’re unhappy with how the&nbsp;ESFA&nbsp;has dealt with your complaint.</p>
